  ![appLogoPng](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9966eef-df48-4a6c-b728-28f6b1b09cbe)

Koyar is a mobile application built to address the issue of uninformed voting in Nigeria. It aims to educate Nigerian voters about candidates and their policies, encouraging objective, informed decision-making over emotional or cultural biases. By providing accessible, non-partisan, fact-based information and simplifying the voting process, Koyar empowers voters to make informed decisions for the betterment of their communities and the nation as a whole.

## Why Koyar?

In Nigeria, elections are often influenced by tribal, emotional, or religious biases, resulting in leadership choices that may not serve the best interest of the public. Koyar aims to change this narrative by providing easily accessible, unbiased, and fact-based information on candidates, their policies, and the voting process. Our goal is to ensure voters are well-informed, engaged, and can vote confidently in the upcoming elections.

## Future Features

We have exciting features planned for future versions of the Koyar app to further enhance voter education and engagement:

- **AI Chatbot**: An AI-driven chatbot to assist users with any questions related to voter registration, candidate policies, or the voting process.
  
- **Discussion Forums**: A platform where users can engage in healthy discussions, share opinions, and ask questions about elections and candidates in a moderated environment.
  
- **FAQ Section**: A frequently asked questions section to answer common voter concerns, including registration, polling unit locations, and voting procedures.

- **Election Myths vs Facts**: An informational section dedicated to debunking common election myths and presenting facts, helping voters make decisions based on accurate information.

## Challenges Faced

One of the major challenges we encountered during the development of Koyar was **access to reliable and up-to-date candidate-related information**. In many cases, information about candidates' policies and track records was either incomplete or not easily accessible. To overcome this, we utilized **Google Sheets** and **Firebase** to centralize and update data, ensuring that voters have access to the most accurate and current information available.

## Built With

- **Flutter**: A powerful cross-platform UI toolkit that enables Koyar to run on both Android and iOS platforms with a single codebase.
- **Firebase**: Used for backend services including authentication, real-time data syncing, and cloud storage.
- **Google Sheets**: Utilized for storing and managing election data, ensuring the information is up-to-date and accessible.
- **Push Notifications**: Keep users informed about critical dates and information related to elections and voter registration.
